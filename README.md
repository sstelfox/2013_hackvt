## Caveat

This app was build in about 24 hours and is NOT production ready.

The punch list of Long term tasks in order to make it production ready:

* Better adminstration of Police and Bike Shop users
* Build out backend email notification behavior
* Handle Geolocation more appropriately
* Add an activity stream of Found / Stolen Bike activity
* Add a production ready DB such as Postgres
